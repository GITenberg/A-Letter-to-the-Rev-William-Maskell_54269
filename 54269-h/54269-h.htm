class="smcap">My Dear Maskell</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> these &ldquo;last days,&rdquo;
in which &ldquo;perilous times&rdquo; have &ldquo;come,&rdquo; it
seems a duty, to be somewhat less nice and scrupulous as to any
charge of presumption or lack of modesty to which a man may lay
himself open by making known his thoughts upon the great matters
which now agitate us, than would be the case at another
time.&nbsp; One whose name will add no weight to any thing he may
say, might well shrink under ordinary circumstances from
commenting upon your recent letter, and appear, even to himself,
over-bold in supposing he can add any thing to the views therein
expounded.&nbsp; But the very pain with which we approach these
topics is some warrant to express our thoughts; inasmuch as it
is, I think, something of a guarantee that whatever is said, will
be, at any rate, not said lightly.&nbsp; Most heartily do I
desire to adopt and echo your words &ldquo;that the enquiry on
which we are all engaged is far too great to admit of any
personal consideration; and our aim is not to win a victory, or
to prove that we ourselves are in the right, but to discover the
truth, and point it out to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If then I imagine a line of argument tending to elucidate this
truth, has been partially overlooked in the expression of your
views, I trust I shall stand excused, both by yourself and any
others who may read <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>this letter, from the charge of a too great boldness in
writing it.&nbsp; The crisis and exigence of the time is, as it
appears to me, too great to allow us to stand upon niceties, or
permit any thing to be kept back which may even by possibility be
found of service in indicating the line of duty.</p>
<p>Let me, however, here say in the very outset, I am not by any
means about to attempt an answer to your letter; a task for which
I am, in the first place, not qualified, and in the second place,
not disposed.&nbsp; I feel the difficulties you bring forward too
much myself to be prepared to ignore them, though I will not say
I go with you in the whole of the positions you are concerned to
establish.&nbsp; But it is <i>became</i> I feel the pressure of
many of them so strongly; <i>because</i>, much as the names of
Mr. Keble and of many who take the same line of argument with
him, are to be revered, nevertheless, I am at a loss to make up
my mind that they have established an unassailable position in
denying the competency and authority of the court of the
Committee of Privy Council, that I am the more anxious to say a
few words upon one point which appears to me to have escaped your
notice.</p>
<p>Let me come at once to this point: and to do so I cannot,
perhaps, proceed more conveniently than by making a quotation
from your letter.&nbsp; At page 54, you say:&mdash;&ldquo;No
doubt this court,&rdquo; (The Judicial Committee of Privy
Council,) &ldquo;nor any other court cannot make canons: but, as
has been before said, this is a question, not of new canons and
formularies, but of the right construction of old ones.&nbsp;
Now, in such a cause, either the court of the Judicial Committee
has authority or it has not: . . .&nbsp; If then the decision of
the court is to be listened to <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>at all, it is not easy to discover how
one will be able to draw distinctions, and place limitations upon
the extent to which it reaches.&nbsp; <i>There seems to be no
middle way between accepting and acting upon it</i>, <i>and
repudiating it altogether as if it had never existed</i>.&nbsp; I
mean, repudiating it in every other respect than in the one
point, comparatively unimportant and trivial, of the institution
of a certain person to a certain benefice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You say, it is not easy to discover a middle way.&nbsp; I
would hope, though not <i>easy</i>, it may be <i>not
impossible</i>.</p>
<p>Let me however here, and in the first place, clear myself from
any suspicion, if you should be inclined to attach it to me, that
I am about to seek a middle course by softening the amount of
error contained in a denial of the exclusive doctrine of
regeneration in baptism.&nbsp; Let me not be deemed guilty, even
in thought, of doubting that such denial is a denial of the
&ldquo;one baptism for the remission of sins,&rdquo; and is
absolute unmitigated heresy; being such as would have shut out
any Church permitting its profession, from the communion of
Christendom in the primitive ages; such as no Church can
maintain, and remain a living branch of the one Body of
Christ.&nbsp; I cast to the winds and repudiate with all my soul,
that spurious charity of our day, which would seek to
&ldquo;please men&rdquo; at the expense of God&rsquo;s truth;
which would recommend the Gospel by denying the Faith; which
would render it more popular or palatable, by explaining away the
Creeds; and all, to be able to include <i>the more</i> within the
Church&rsquo;s pale, under the plea of an extended
usefulness.&nbsp; Such liberality (with what is not our own to
give,) is, in my estimation, a giving away God&rsquo;s honour,
and so, mere and absolute treason against <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span><span
class="smcap">Him</span>: therefore is a giving away our place in
His Church, and a blotting out it&rsquo;s name from the book of
life.</p>
<p>Let me explain further: that in what I am about to write, I am
going to admit, at any rate for the sake of argument, the
authority and jurisdiction of the Committee of Council as a
tribunal in this case.&nbsp; I may, and indeed do think, that in
your letter, you have allowed too little for the difficulty in
which the Church has been placed as to making her voice heard:
too little therefore to the circumstances which have hitherto
trammelled her, as accounting for and excusing her silence,
especially in later times: as for example in the changes made in
1832, and perhaps in other instances.&nbsp; Still I am not
concerned in what I am about to write to controvert your
positions on this matter, because for the present purpose of my
argument I am going to admit the competency, i.e. the authority
as distinct of course from the fitness, of this tribunal to try
the issue, between Mr. Gorham and the Bishop of Exeter.</p>
<p>Still, as it seems to me, both these points may be conceded:
first that the court is sufficient: and secondly, that to deny
unconditional regeneration in the case of infants, is heresy; and
yet, it may be reasonably maintained, that whatever the decision
in this trial shall be, The Church of England may not stand
committed to heresy thereby.</p>
<p>No doubt, at first sight this will appear a paradox; and the
interpreter the harder to be understood of the two, in thus
imagining it not impossible to find a middle way between
&ldquo;accepting and acting upon this court&rsquo;s decision, and
repudiating it altogether as if it had never
existed.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I mean, not impossible to <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>find a point of
view, regarding the tribunal from which, we may be able justly
and reasonably to allow it&rsquo;s competency for the present
judgment on doctrine, and yet to repudiate, not exactly the
decision itself, but the effect of it as committing the Church at
large: repudiate it, in your own words, &ldquo;in every other
respect, but the one point comparatively unimportant and trivial
of the institution of a certain person to a certain
benefice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the only postulate I ask for this conclusion, is, that the
Church shall not, and cannot, stand committed to heresy without
proof that her crime is something not accidental, but wilful and
deliberate; something more than a mistake, which she is ready and
willing to clear up the moment opportunity is given her to do
so.&nbsp; In short that as a man is not a liar, without the
intention to deceive; so a Church is not heretical, unless the
animus of heresy be proved against her.</p>
<p>If you will concede me thus much, I think I may be able to
shew that there is a middle course between denying the
jurisdiction of the Court, and admitting the <i>weight</i> even
if I allow the justness, of the sentence: that is to say, the
sentence may be such as under the circumstances, the judges were
bound to give, (I am not conceding but supposing this:) and it
may therefore carry the conclusion that the Church&rsquo;s
formularies on the subject in question are indistinct; still
without proving also that the Church ever intended them to be so;
and therefore without affording ground to say that, though her
words are ambiguous, her heart and mind have ever been
heretical.&nbsp; Of course upon the strength of the sentence, if
thus given, Mr. Gorham would gain his institution; but I say
again, I do not think the Church would be committed to his
heresy.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Let us
consider again, what it is precisely which the judicial Committee
of Council are about to do. <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a>&nbsp; It cannot be
stated more entirely according to my sense, than in your own
words.&nbsp; You say (page 7) &ldquo;The question is one simply
of <i>interpretation of the Law of the Church of England</i> . .
.&nbsp; It is not a question of what is in itself true or untrue,
agreeable or not agreeable to the Holy Scriptures, but solely
whether a certain doctrine has or has not been clearly defined to
the exclusion of some other statement about the same doctrine,
which would seem to deny it or explain it away.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again in the passage already quoted (p. 54) &ldquo;This is a
question not of new canons and formularies, but of the right
construction of old ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then if this be so: though the Decision should affirm what
shall be in its form, heresy, may there not still be a limitation
as to its effect: rather perhaps I should say, a suspension of
the actual heresy altogether until some further condition shall
be fulfilled to give it life: that is to say, though the decision
may affirm that the formularies of the Church of England do not
so clearly define the faith on this point, as to preclude the
words admitting an uncatholic, nay an heretical interpretation,
does it follow that the animus of the Church is therefore even in
the least degree shown to desire or intend to teach such error,
nay even to allow it to be taught; and if there be no heretical
animus, can She be pronounced herself to have incurred the guilt
of heresy?&nbsp; I answer, (and I hope safely) to both questions;
No! because all that will <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>be brought out, even in the event of
the decision of the court of appeal being to reverse the judgment
of the court below, will be merely that there is <i>an ambiguity
of language</i>, in the documents on which that court had to
found its judgment; and this, an ambiguity, it may be,
unintentional on the part of the Church, though really inherent
in the wording of her formularies, acting therefore imperatively
on the judges in the case (if so,) and <i>obliging</i> them to
give a decision such as shall leave the point at issue, an open
question.&nbsp; Let me be well understood.&nbsp; If such
ambiguity of language be intentional on the part of the Church;
if she can be proved to have <i>desired</i> in drawing up her
articles and services to admit two interpretations on baptismal
regeneration: if it be her view and plan to include two such
opposite parties within her as those represented by Mr. Gorham
and the Bishop of Exeter, by such ambiguous, and therefore
comprehensive language, I most fully admit she stands convicted
of unpalliated heresy both in form and matter.&nbsp; But if it be
lawful without violence to reason or conscience to believe she
had no such view, but meant to assert the undoubted ancient
catholic faith on baptism, I do not think we are bound to make
her answerable, as if she had knowingly and wilfully assented to
uncatholic doctrine, though as it turns out (if so it be) the
wording of her formularies is inadvertently insufficient to
protect the one truth.&nbsp; I cannot but think that though the
misfortune of such inadvertence is not to be denied, its
guiltiness is not lightly to be admitted; and that we are bound
in all reason, (and I am sure if so, in conscience and loyalty)
not to consider her chained by such ambiguous language to the
denial of God&rsquo;s truth, and the catholic faith.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>With
regard then to the animus in question.&nbsp; Surely in the first
place we may say this; that it is not settled adversely to sound
doctrine, because not involved in, this decision itself, whatever
it may be.&nbsp; The Judges in the present trial would I imagine,
even though using to guide them in their judgment contemporary
documents, and even contemporary opinions to elucidate the
language of the formularies, yet themselves admit, that to
<i>decide the animus</i> with which those formularies were
originally drawn up, is <i>beside</i> the point they have had to
try: that it suffices for them to declare the ambiguity if they
find it in the words; but that it is foreign to the matter in
hand to settle whether such ambiguity be accidental or
intentional.&nbsp; Of course I am not saying they would
<i>deny</i> the intention of comprehensiveness.&nbsp; On the
contrary they would probably appear as a matter of course to
infer it; and may even make mention of what they suppose the
intention of the Church to have been: but still they will not
<i>rule</i> the animus, as a part of their judgment.&nbsp; As to
mere legal consequences indeed, I presume they will necessarily
so far imply the intention to have been according to the judgment
they deliver, as fully to give the benefit of their construction
to the appellant in the cause: but yet this intention is to be
distinguished, as a different point from any which they have had
to try, which has surely been merely <i>what is</i> in the words
of the formularies, <i>not how</i> it came to be there.</p>
<p>But even should the court proceed so far as to say it gives
its judgment on the latitudinarian side, expressly on the ground
that it believes the Church in drawing up her formularies
intended such comprehension, even that declaration would have no
judicial authority to impose itself on any man as the
truth.&nbsp; <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>The <i>grounds</i> of a judge&rsquo;s sentence are a
different thing from the <i>sentence itself</i>; and, I think all
those &ldquo;learned in the law&rdquo; will bear me out in
saying, form no part of it.&nbsp; It is not an impossible nor an
unheard of case for a judge to give a right judgment, yet upon
wrong grounds.&nbsp; The <i>grounds</i> are merely <i>his
opinion</i> which challenge no authority beyond their intrinsic
weight, and which any man may canvas; the <i>judgement</i> is
<i>authoritative</i>, and of course in a court from which there
is no appeal, is assumed ex necessitate rei, to be sound.</p>
<p>Let us then next proceed with one or two considerations which
may be of service in determining for ourselves what animus we
shall attribute to the Church in drawing up those of her
formularies which bear upon the doctrine of baptism.</p>
<p>A point of great weight surely is this:&mdash;that they are
(even if really ambiguous when subjected to the searching eyes
and acute minds of the most subtle lawyers: I use the word in no
ill sense; yet) to all ordinary men, and ordinary unbiassed
minds, so clearly on the catholic side, and so plainly to such
minds convey nothing but the ancient doctrine of regeneration in
baptism, that it is much more easy and natural to believe the
Church never contemplated the ambiguity than that she did.&nbsp;
Let it be remembered too that if now on the present appeal, the
six eminent law officers who have heard the case do decide for
the ambiguity, yet, so indistinctly is this ambiguity itself
discernible, that not merely ordinary men, but one of the ablest
and perhaps <i>the</i> most practised ecclesiastical lawyer of
our day, had no doubt or hesitation on his mind when the case was
argued before him as the Archbishop&rsquo;s judge of doctrine in
the court of <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Arches, that it did not exist; that there was no such
<i>approach</i> even to ambiguous language as to make him have
recourse to extraneous comment to guide him, or cause him to give
in the very slightest degree a doubtful judgment; but on the
contrary, thought there was no sense to be put upon the
Church&rsquo;s statements on this subject but the one catholic
doctrine, which, a priori, we should suppose she would
enunciate.</p>
<p>Take with these general considerations the particular
circumstance that if we assert the ambiguous animus, we must
suppose the Church, not only in fact to have inadvertently
qualified words naturally carrying the catholic meaning; but so
to have intended to qualify them, that when she says
&ldquo;seeing this child is regenerate,&rdquo; she meant
&ldquo;seeing he is not regenerate,&rdquo; or, at the least,
&ldquo;seeing I have no reason to believe he is
regenerate,&rdquo; and shall we not have a sufficient case to
prevent our feeling compelled to &ldquo;think&rdquo; that
&ldquo;evil,&rdquo; that the Church had a double mind.&nbsp; To
me, at least these thoughts bring home a satisfactory conviction
that it is much more likely the Church herself has been ignorant
of ambiguity, and did not mean to be indefinite, than that she
purposely drew up her articles and services, with merely such a
subtle and almost imperceptible residuum of doubtful words that
it appears a mere chance, under a peculiar combination of
circumstances that it ever comes to the light at all: that she so
speciously concealed her own desire to include a second meaning,
that taken &ldquo;in her own craftiness&rdquo; she deceived Sir
Herbert Jenner Fust, so that even when her words were most
elaborately sifted by him, this hidden sense escaped his
observation; and is only now at last made manifest upon the most
laboured and minute investigation in another court, <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>where it is
not too much to say there has been every inducement to the
learned judges composing it to split hairs, and find an ambiguity
if by possibility they could.&nbsp; I say this not as impeaching
the impartiality of the tribunal, but yet as worthy of note by
any, who knowing what human nature is, would rightly weigh the
circumstances of this decision before drawing further inferences
from it.&nbsp; If I am at all correct in the argument I have
attempted to draw out, that decision, if in Mr. Gorham&rsquo;s
favour, will decide the ambiguous language of the formularies,
and nothing more.&nbsp; Abstract then your mind from the present
judgment, and what will you say is the animus of the
Church?&nbsp; Will it not be the same as heretofore; and that our
estimation of our Church&rsquo;s soundness in the faith is as yet
unshaken?&nbsp; For should we, I boldly ask, judge that any
friend of ours intended an indirectness or double dealing by us
upon no better evidence?&nbsp; Should <i>you</i> so judge
<i>me</i>, or <i>I you</i>, in any circumstances bearing even a
distant analogy to these? and if not, how thus judge our mother,
who has borne us unto Christ?</p>
<p>An illustration from secular affairs may perhaps make my
meaning in all this clearer, and, as it happens, there is one
made ready to our hand.</p>
<p>We all remember the act of Lord Ashley and the late Mr.
Fielden, to prohibit the labour of young persons in factories,
for more than ten hours a day.&nbsp; It was drawn up, no doubt,
to the best of their ability to attain this object: to give
persons under a specified age, rest and cessation from labour
after ten hours at the mill.&nbsp; But as we well know likewise,
an interpretation of the act grew into use among the mill-owners,
by which they worked their factories twelve or fifteen <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>hours a day,
using the labours of the younger persons employed by relays; so
that though no one of them was actually at work more than the ten
hours, the object of the bill was frustrated, if it were to
secure their being dismissed to their homes after so many hours
at the mill.&nbsp; The resting them an hour, or two hours, in the
middle of the day, whilst others took their place, to be also
rested for the same time, at another period, did not secure to
those young persons what was at any rate supposed to be the
humane object of the framers of the bill, and the legislature
which passed it; a return to their homes at such a reasonably
early hour as might afford some time for relaxation, and some
opportunity for mental cultivation.&nbsp; This usage however of
the mill-owners did not pass unquestioned, and a case involving
the principle of it, was first heard before an inferior tribunal,
and, the decision being given there I think, against the legality
of the system of relays, was brought afterwards by appeal before
the Barons of the Exchequer.&nbsp; The jurisdiction, observe, of
this court was beyond all question, and it applied itself to the
decision of the case.&nbsp; Of course, (exactly as in the Gorham
cause before the Privy Council,) the matter in hand was simply a
question of the interpretation of the act of parliament.&nbsp;
The judges had nothing to do with <i>which</i> arrangement might
be most humane, nor even with which they imagined to be most
accordant with the mind of parliament in passing the act, if the
act itself were clear to their understanding.&nbsp; They most
properly confined themselves to the terms of the act, and to the
determination of this point, whether it excluded the working by
relays or not.&nbsp; It might be, (as has been strongly
asserted,) perfectly true, that to permit that system, <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>frustrated in
great measure, if not wholly, the attempt to better the condition
of those young persons; but however true, it was nothing to the
purpose.&nbsp; And those judges, as the event shewed did come to
the conclusion that the terms in which the act was couched were
not sufficient to make the system which had been used, illegal:
and therefore judgment went in favour of the mill-owners.</p>
<p>Now let it be granted that this, in its effect, destroys the
bill as a measure of humanity: that so to legislate is in fact
<i>cruelty</i>, whatever the intention of the act may have
been.</p>
<p>But shall we on this account blame the judges in the
case?&nbsp; Assuredly not; they have but done their necessary
duty in interpretation.&nbsp; Shall we say the court was not
competent, or the decision not binding, or in any way attempt to
resist its legal effect?&nbsp; Assuredly not; or we overthrow all
principles of law and order.&nbsp; Nevertheless shall we say that
this judgment convicts of cruelty or double dealing the framers
of the measure, or the parliament which passed it?&nbsp;
Assuredly not; because it is much easier; much more accordant
with common sense and experience; much more agreeable to charity
and reason, to believe that the subtleties of language introduced
an unintentional ambiguity, which the judge&rsquo;s eye was
obliged to search out and judicially recognize, than to believe
that Mr. Fielden, or Lord Ashley, or even parliament at large,
when they professed to relieve young persons working in
factories, intended to &ldquo;palter with them in a double sense
and keep the word of promise to the ear but break it to the
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does any one then, I ask again, now feel justified in charging
those parties with cruelty, whose bill is <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>nevertheless
found capable of a cruel working.&nbsp; Do we charge them with
the intention of such ambiguity, and such consequences, though
they are found both to exist in the act of parliament?&nbsp; Do
we infer the animus from the wording, and say that such as the
bill is practically, such <i>must</i> have been the intention of
its framers?</p>
<p>The application is so obvious, I fear to be tedious in drawing
it out ever so briefly.&nbsp; But, for <i>Parliament</i> read,
<i>Church</i>; for <i>The Ten Hour Factory Bill</i>, read <i>The
Formularies bearing upon Baptism</i>; for <i>Doubledealing and
Cruelty</i> read <i>False Doctrine and Heresy</i>: and if in both
cases, there be an ambiguity, and yet we charge no such
double-dealing or cruelty on the one, as believing no such animus
existed, or need be suspected in the parties who framed the one
document, may we not equally acquit of false doctrine or heresy
those who drew up the others because, though these may perchance
be latent in the wording of them, no such animus is shown, or
need be suspected in their authors: <i>i.e.</i> the Church which
has sanctioned and used them.</p>
<p>There is another point in this analogy which will carry us a
step further, and in a most practical direction.</p>
<p>If the legislature now, knowing all these circumstances, and
having the power to correct the error, if so it regard that to
which the ambiguous or careless wording of the Act of Parliament
has led, yet take no measure for correcting it, and for
re-asserting the humane principle which we are told it was
intended to embody, this conduct will surely commit parliament
now to the adoption of the bill as last interpreted.&nbsp; It
would be too much to say even so, that it would convict <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the framers
of the measure some four or five years ago, or the then
parliament of either fraud or cruelty: but it might well fasten
those charges upon the present parliament if they believe the act
was intended to work otherwise but will not restore it to its
efficiency.&nbsp; And so now, in our parallel case.&nbsp; If the
Church of this our day, knowing all the circumstances of such an
interpretation as we have been supposing in the matter of
baptismal regeneration, do not use the powers she may have to
correct the ambiguity which permits heresy to be lodged within
her, she will acquiesce in and adopt that heresy as her
own.&nbsp; It would indeed here again be too much to say that
such conduct now would prove there had been a double-mind; an
intended ambiguity for an heretical purpose in those who drew up
our formularies; for <i>they</i> might still have no more
intended heresy, than Lord Ashley and the late Mr. Fielden
cruelty to the factory children.&nbsp; But this, however it might
clear the respective characters of men of another day, would be
nothing at all as to establishing a claim to soundness now, or
preserving the Church of England as a living branch of the Church
of Christ.&nbsp; If we now adopt the heretical interpretation: if
we now knowingly and wilfully continue the ambiguity; if we do
not strive to remove the blot on the face of the Spouse of
Christ; we shall be answerable as a body for the heresy, and must
take the consequences both here and hereafter.</p>
<p>What then is the practical thing to be done in this exigence,
supposing the decision now about to be given to be one admitting
heresy?</p>
<p>No doubt there is much difference between our case here, and
that in the analogy we have been using.&nbsp; <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>The State
<i>can</i>, beyond all question, take up its doubtful matter, and
re-word it, in another meaning, too plain to be denied.&nbsp; The
Church (among us) alas! has no freedom of speech: no direct power
of action; no immediate method by which to correct the
ambiguity.</p>
<p>But nevertheless she must do all she can, according to the
means she has, or she will not be clear in this matter; and the
most evident of all the steps for her to take is at once, and in
earnest, and with her whole heart, to petition the throne to be
permitted to meet in convocation to take these points into
practical consideration.&nbsp; If she do all she <i>can</i>, she
will not be to be judged, that she can do no more; but at any
rate, I think any one of us may, nay every one of us should,
suspend our judgment as to her being committed to heresy until we
see what it is she <i>will</i> do.</p>
<p>Having gone thus far in considering our position and duties, I
will venture a little further, (I trust without presumption
offering it merely as a suggestion,) to state what appears to me,
the first actual step to be taken.</p>
<p>Though as a Church we cannot meet in synod until called
together by the Crown, yet as Englishmen, as mere subjects of the
empire we may meet and petition the throne that convocation may
be licensed to deliberate upon the momentous questions which now
affect the Church.&nbsp; As soon then as conveniently may be
after the decision of the Privy Council shall be given, (and I
may as well say here, that it appears to me to make very little
practical difference as to the necessity of such a step, whatever
that decision may be:) as soon then as conveniently may be after,
a meeting should be called in London of all persons clerical and
lay alike, who desire to see a freer action <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of the
Church, for this one specific purpose to address the throne
praying her Majesty graciously to concede to the troubled hearts
and perplexed consciences of so many of her subjects, that
convocation may be summoned for dispatch of business.&nbsp; The
day should be carefully chosen: that it be not too soon nor too
late: not too soon for it to be thoroughly and widely known, and
for all who may be anxious to be present to make their
arrangements accordingly; not too late, so as to beget any
suspicion of lukewarmness.&nbsp; The Archbishop of Canterbury or
the Bishop of London, should unquestionably with all duty and
reverence be asked to preside; and all our Right Reverend Fathers
in God, be requested to give us their help and blessing in this
endeavour.&nbsp; All Churchmen who feel in these dangerous days
it would be a great comfort and advantage to hear the
Church&rsquo;s voice distinctly indicating the course to be
pursued, within any reasonable reach of that gathering, ay, and
beyond it, would, it is to be hoped, attend.&nbsp; No extraneous
matter should be gone into, and if possible the speaking, (at
least so it appears to me,) should be but brief, allowing, if it
may be, several hours afterwards for the sole purpose of those
actually present to sign the address before leaving the
room.&nbsp; I cannot doubt myself that the largest room in London
would be insufficient for the numbers who would make a point of
coming, and each man as he went away might say, with a heart of
thankfulness, &ldquo;Liberavi animam meam,&rdquo; and &ldquo;God
defend the Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do not think in saying these things I am vain enough to
suppose this must needs be the best plan to follow.&nbsp; I do
but mention my own thought as a suggestion for others to
consider, and I speak in some detail, because at any rate, by
this means a practical character is given <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>to what I
say.&nbsp; What is best will be determined by others much more
competent to decide, and I shall I trust be found ready to
follow, wherever the path of duty shall be found to lead.</p>
<p>He would be a bold man who should venture to say what the
events of a few years, nay even of one, may bring: but I think
those certainly are not mistaken who deem that we are in a great
crisis of our Church&rsquo;s lot, and that very much depends upon
our faithfulness, our wisdom, and our courage now.&nbsp; I have
therefore been anxious to lay before you and any others whose
hearts are burdened with our present troubles some of the
thoughts which have occurred to my mind.&nbsp; I have been more
particularly anxious to ask whether I am wholly beside the mark
of reason and sound sense, in thinking it possible to see a
middle way &ldquo;between accepting and acting upon the
decision&rdquo; of the Privy Council, &ldquo;and repudiating it
altogether as if it had never existed.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a
persuasion that such a middle course there is, I have endeavoured
to show how far the Judicial Committee commits the Church of
England by its decision, even allowing it to have jurisdiction in
points of doctrine, and my conclusion has been that we may admit
both the authority of the tribunal, and also the formal heresy
involved in the judgment it may feel bound to deliver in its duty
of interpretation, and yet allow no stigma of actual heresy to
lie upon the Church, unless she acquiesce in, and adopt that
judgment as her own: that is, no further stigma, no further evil
than, (to use again your words) &ldquo;in the one point
comparatively unimportant and trivial of the institution of a
certain person to a certain benefice.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am glad to
think I recognize in this sentence an admission, that if the
Church can be freed <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>from any further participation in the doctrine involved,
and if she do her best to repudiate any implication with heresy
which that judgment may seem to throw upon her, she may well wait
the time (I do not say for ever, but at any rate for the
present,) till she may be enabled to clear up all ambiguity by
restoring the full catholic sense to her formularies, through the
legitimate channel of her own assembly and convocation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I will but express how much consolation it
affords my mind to think that the &ldquo;burden and heat&rdquo;
of this trial, fall upon one so eminently fitted, as I believe,
to bear them.&nbsp; In spite of all the sorrow which one cannot
but feel that at his time of life when there should be the rest
and repose which in less trying times, and to less true soldiers
&ldquo;should accompany old age,&rdquo; <i>he</i> should be
called upon still to stand in the battle&rsquo;s front, and bear
its fiercest shock; in spite I say of this sorrow, there yet
comes over me a lightening of heart and soul when I think this
trial has not fallen upon one less equal to the emergency; less
clear-sighted to see the line of duty; less bold to do it.&nbsp;
If the burden indeed be heavy to any one of us; Oh! how much
more, to him!&nbsp; And yet it is not merely a pleasure and a
comfort, but a source of the most heartfelt thankfulness that the
present Bishop of Exeter <i>is</i> what he <i>is</i>.&nbsp; If
<i>we</i> are in doubt, yet <i>he</i> may have no cloud upon his
mind.&nbsp; If <i>we</i> almost fail and faint, yet <i>he</i> is
one to rally us.&nbsp; If <i>we</i> know not how to take or
interpret the signs of the times, and question what is the path
of duty, yet is <i>he</i> one most able to enlighten and to guide
us: most fitted (<i>who</i> in our time so much?) to
&ldquo;render a reason&rdquo; for what he does, or advises should
be done, and <i>so</i> render it, as to <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>attach the
faithful; confirm the wavering; and confound the
gainsayers.&nbsp; I could almost weep for grief to think of the
harassings and care of heart which he must undergo all these
days; but for joy also that I believe they fall in God&rsquo;s
providence, upon a prelate, than whom the English Church has had
none, since Laud, of a greater heart, to do or suffer all that
may be needful in her cause.&nbsp; Whilst then in these days of
rebuke and blasphemy we pray for all, let it be doubly for him,
that he may see his way clearly in order to guide us also; that a
double portion of that great Archbishop&rsquo;s Spirit may rest
upon him, both for his own comfort, and the benefit of
God&rsquo;s people; and that even if his very mantle should
descend upon him, (there are other martyrdoms than those of the
scaffold or the stake;) <i>he</i> may &ldquo;be strengthened
continually with might in the inner man,&rdquo; and <i>we</i> may
have grace, to <i>endure</i> to see him wear it.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
